# Heart-Disease-Classification

## Predicting heart disease using machine learning

This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

We're going to take the following approach:

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

## Problem Definition

In a statement,
> "Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?"

## Data

The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset
